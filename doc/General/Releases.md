# LibreNMS Releases

We try to ensure that breaking changes aren't introduced by utilising various automated 
code testing, syntax testing and unit testing along with manual code review. However 
bugs can and do get introduced as well as major refactoring to improve the quality of 
the code base.

With this in mind, we provide a monthly stable release which is released on or around 
the last Sunday of the month. Code pull requests (aside from Bug fixes) are stopped days 
leading up to the release to ensure that we have a clean working branch at that point.

The releases are titled after that month in the format `YYYYMM`, i.e `201608`. The 
Changelog is also updated and will reference the release number and date so you can see 
what changes have been made since the last release.
