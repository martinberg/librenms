# Authentication modules

LibreNMS supports multiple authentication modules along with [Two Factor Auth](http://docs.librenms.org/Extensions/Two-Factor-Auth/).
Here we will provide configuration details for these modules.

#### Available authentication modules

- MySQL: mysql

- LDAP: ldap

- Active Directory: active_directory

- HTTP Auth: http-auth

- Radius: radius

#### User levels

- 1: Normal User. You will need to assign device / port permissions for users at this level.

- 5: Global Read.

- 10: This is a global read/write admin account

- 11: Demo Account. Provides full read/write with certain restrictions (i.e can't delete devices).

#### Enable authentication module

To enable a particular authentication module you need to set this up in config.php.

```php
$config['auth_mechanism'] = "mysql";
```

#### MySQL Authentication

Config option: `mysql`

This is default option with LibreNMS so you should have already got the configuration setup.

```php
$config['db_host'] = "HOSTNAME";
$config['db_user'] = "DBUSER";
$config['db_pass'] = "DBPASS";
$config['db_name'] = "DBNAME";
```

#### HTTP Authentication

Config option: `http-auth`

LibreNMS will expect the user to have authenticated via your webservice already. At this stage it will need to assign a
userlevel for that user which is done in one of two ways:

- A user exists in MySQL still where the usernames match up.

- A global guest user (which still needs to be added into MySQL:
```php
$config['http_auth_guest'] = "guest";
```
This will then assign the userlevel for guest to all authenticated users.

#### LDAP Authentication

Config option: `ldap`

This one is a little more complicated :)

First of all, install ___php-ldap___ for CentOS/RHEL or ___php5-ldap___ for Ubuntu/Debian.

```php
$config['auth_ldap_version'] = 3; # v2 or v3
$config['auth_ldap_server'] = "ldap.example.com";
$config['auth_ldap_port']   = 389;
$config['auth_ldap_prefix'] = "uid=";
$config['auth_ldap_suffix'] = ",ou=People,dc=example,dc=com";
$config['auth_ldap_group']  = "cn=groupname,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com";

$config['auth_ldap_groupbase'] = "ou=group,dc=example,dc=com";
$config['auth_ldap_groups']['admin']['level'] = 10;
$config['auth_ldap_groups']['pfy']['level'] = 7;
$config['auth_ldap_groups']['support']['level'] = 1;
$config['auth_ldap_groupmemberattr'] = "memberUid";
```

Typically auth_ldap_suffix, auth_ldap_group, auth_ldap_groupbase, auth_ldap_groups are what's required to be configured.

An example config setup for use with Jumpcloud LDAP as a service is:

```php
$config['auth_mechanism'] = "ldap"; # default, other options: ldap, http-auth
unset($config['auth_ldap_group']);
unset($config['auth_ldap_groups']);
$config['auth_ldap_groups']['librenms']['level'] = 10;
$config['auth_ldap_version'] = 3; # v2 or v3
$config['auth_ldap_server'] = "ldap.jumpcloud.com";
$config['auth_ldap_port'] = 389;
$config['auth_ldap_prefix'] = "uid=";
$config['auth_ldap_suffix'] = ",ou=Users,o={id},dc=jumpcloud,dc=com";
$config['auth_ldap_groupbase'] = "cn=librenms,ou=Users,o={id},dc=jumpcloud,dc=com";
$config['auth_ldap_groupmemberattr'] = "memberUid";
```

Replace {id} with the unique ID provided by Jumpcloud.

#### HTTP Authentication / LDAP Authorization

Config option: `ldap-authorization`

This module is a combination of ___http-auth___ and ___ldap___

LibreNMS will expect the user to have authenticated via your webservice already (e.g. using Kerberos Authentication in Apache) but will use LDAP to determine and assign the userlevel of a user.
The userlevel will be calculated by using LDAP group membership information as the ___ldap___ module does.

The configuration is the same as for the ___ldap___ module with one extra option: auth_ldap_cache_ttl.
This option allows to control how long user information (user_exists, userid, userlevel) are cached within the PHP Session.
The default value is 300 seconds.
To disabled this caching (highly discourage) set this option to 0.

```php
$config['auth_ldap_cache_ttl'] = 300;
```

#### Active Directory Authentication

Config option: `active_directory`

This is similar to LDAP Authentication. Install __php_ldap__ for CentOS/RHEL or __php5-ldap__ for Debian/Ubuntu.

If you have issues with secure LDAP try setting `$config['auth_ad_check_certificates']` to `0`.

##### Require actual membership of the configured groups

If you set ```$config['auth_ad_require_groupmembership']``` to 1, the authenticated user has to be a member of the specific group. Otherwise all users can authenticate, but are limited to user level 0 and only have access to shared dashboards.

> Cleanup of old accounts is done using the authlog. You will need to set the cleanup date for when old accounts will be purged which will happen AUTOMATICALLY.
> Please ensure that you set the $config['authlog_purge'] value to be greater than $config['active_directory]['users_purge'] otherwise old users won't be removed.


##### Sample configuration

```
$config['auth_ad_url']                      = "ldaps://your-domain.controll.er";
$config['auth_ad_check_certificates']       = 1; // or 0
$config['auth_ad_domain']                   = "your-domain.com";
$config['auth_ad_base_dn']                  = "dc=your-domain,dc=com";
$config['auth_ad_groups']['<ad-admingroup>']['level'] = 10;
$config['auth_ad_groups']['<ad-usergroup>']['level']   = 7;
$config['auth_ad_require_groupmembership']  = 0;
$config['active_directory']['users_purge']  = 14;//Purge users who haven't logged in for 14 days.
```

Replace `<ad-admingroup>` with your Active Directory admin-user group and `<ad-usergroup>` with your standard user group.

#### Radius Authentication

Please note that a mysql user is created for each user the logs in successfully. User level 1 is assigned to those accounts so you will then need to assign the relevant permissions unless you set `$config['radius']['userlevel']` to be something other than 1.

> Cleanup of old accounts is done using the authlog. You will need to set the cleanup date for when old accounts will be purged which will happen AUTOMATICALLY.
> Please ensure that you set the $config['authlog_purge'] value to be greater than $config['radius']['users_purge'] otherwise old users won't be removed.

```php
$config['radius']['hostname']   = 'localhost';
$config['radius']['port']       = '1812';
$config['radius']['secret']     = 'testing123';
$config['radius']['timeout']    = 3;
$config['radius']['users_purge'] = 14;//Purge users who haven't logged in for 14 days.
$config['radius']['default_level'] = 1;//Set the default user level when automatically creating a user.
```
